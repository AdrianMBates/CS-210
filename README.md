# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project provides a command line for modifying and saving data regarding hypothetical animal records. The project solves the issue of maintaining persistent data. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I think the functions are well modularized and allow the main function to be more readable from a high level.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I personally feel like there is far too much code in the major class, and that class has far too many responsibilities/touches too many areas of implementation. In the context of a simple proof of concept project that's fine, but for a long term project that's meant to be maintainable this should be further modularized.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging, or rather, annoying part of this code was the formatting of the data into a text file. If I were to do this with my own specs I would probably use a serializer of some sort. A bit of trial and error, and some review of string formatting methods eventually got me where I needed to be.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I personally don't think that there were any major improvements or skills that I picked up from this project that are transferrable to other projects. However, writing more code is never a bad thing, and I'm glad I can experiment and solve problems with code as part of my course work.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I provided excessive comments and named variables in an clear way to allow for the program to be more readable and maintainable. I also split major functionality into functions to allow more adaptibility.
